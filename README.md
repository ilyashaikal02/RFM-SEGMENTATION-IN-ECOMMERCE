# RFM-SEGMENTATION-IN-ECOMMERCE

**CONTEXT** :

Typically e-commerce datasets are proprietary and consequently hard to find among publicly available data. However, The UCI Machine Learning Repository has made this dataset containing actual transactions from 2010 and 2011. The dataset is maintained on their site, where it can be found by the title "Online Retail".

**CONTENT** : 

This is a transnational data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail.The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers."

**GOAL** :
1. How are the characteristics of customers in each segment/cluster?

2. What is the approach for developing a customized promotion strategy for each cluster, and how is it based on the understanding of the clusters mentioned above?

How are the characteristics of customers in each segment/cluster?

**Cluster 0**: his cluster represents our top segment of users. They are recent and frequent buyers, with their most recent transaction occurring just a few days ago. Over the past six months, they have made 26 transactions. However, this segment comprises only a small portion, with just 66 users, accounting for 1.5 percent of our entire user base.

**Cluster 1**: This cluster consists of churned users, who are customers that have opted out or stopped transacting with us. Their last transaction was more than five months ago, and over the previous six months, they made either zero or only one transaction. Unfortunately, this cluster is quite large, containing 1364 users, equivalent to 31.5 percent of all our users.

**Cluster 2**: The casual segment of users falls under this cluster. They are regular customers, but with moderate transaction frequency and recency. Their most recent transaction took place within the last two months, and they made up to three transactions in the previous six months. This segment represents the largest portion of our user base, with 2908 users, accounting for 67 percent of all our users.

What is the approach for developing a customized promotion strategy for each cluster, and how is it based on the understanding of the clusters mentioned above?

**Top buyers**: Instead of overwhelming them with vouchers/promotions (which saves us money), we will optimize/leverage loyalty points to maintain their loyalty.

**Casual buyers**: To increase the frequency and monetary value of this segment, we will offer cashback vouchers to encourage repeat purchases. However, we will set a high eligibility threshold, such as the voucher being valid for transactions of at least 50 Pounds.

**Churned buyers**: Our primary focus is to re-engage these customers and encourage them to transact with us again. To achieve this, we will offer one or two substantial-benefit vouchers and complement it with a consistent stream of push notifications.
